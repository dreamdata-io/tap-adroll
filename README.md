# tap-adroll

This tap focuses on the Reporting API https://developers.adroll.com/docs/reporting-api/ 

Possible streams are accounts (advertisables), campaigns and deliveries (impressions, clicks, costs).

To start, create `config.json` based on `sample.config.json`. You can run it by using `pipenv`.
